# About project
This project was created for practice and enhancing my coding skills purposes. 

### Author
Elijah Ndung'u

Written using **React** and **TypeScript**.

To get jokes in JSON format was used [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) 

Application has the following features: 
- Ability to get a random joke.
- Ability to get a random joke from categories (Use API to get all available categories).
- Ability to get jokes by free text search.
- Any joke can be marked/unmarked as favourite.
- Jokes marked as favourite appear in the right section Favourite.
- Favourite jokes is available after reloading the page and stored in the browser.

#### Future Improvements

* Add a state manager to the implementation(for better testing functions and isolating state control logic)
* Improve the interaction process with manual joke search(Display message that no jokes were found)
* Add clearer typing and handling of server errors
* Improve accessibility with more WAI-ARIA
